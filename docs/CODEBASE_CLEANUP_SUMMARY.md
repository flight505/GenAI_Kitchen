# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major code reduction and modernization effort completed on the GenAI Kitchen project.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated API Routes to New Prompt Building System**
- Replaced `enhancePromptWithUnoformStyle` with `enhancePromptForAPI` in:
  - `/app/generate/route.ts`
  - `/app/inpaint/route.ts`
  - `/app/variation/route.ts`
- Created new functions in `unoformPromptBuilder.ts`:
  - `enhancePromptForAPI()` - Drop-in replacement for prompt enhancement
  - `createStyleConsistentVariationForAPI()` - Replacement for variation creation

### 2. **Updated Dream Page**
- Removed dependencies on old `KitchenDesignSelections` from `kitchenTypes.ts`
- Removed `generatePromptFromSelections` usage
- Kitchen design selections now handled internally by `DesignTabV2`
- Simplified prompt generation logic

### 3. **Deleted Obsolete Files**

#### Utility Files:
- `utils/promptTemplating.ts` - Replaced by new prompt building system
- `utils/promptTemplatingV2.ts` - Bridge code no longer needed
- `utils/dropdownTypes.ts` - Unused dropdown types
- `utils/kitchenTypes.ts` - Old kitchen selection types

#### Unused Components:
- `components/SquigglyLines.tsx` - No references found
- `components/ResizablePanel.tsx` - Not used anywhere
- `components/KitchenDropDown.tsx` - Replaced by other components
- `components/DropDown.tsx` - Generic dropdown not in use
- `components/comparison/ImageComparisonSlider.tsx` - Replaced by CompareSlider
- `components/tabs/RefineTab.tsx` - Replaced by RefineTabV2
- `components/tabs/DesignTab.tsx` - Replaced by DesignTabV2
- `components/MaskDrawingCanvas.tsx` - Replaced by MaskDrawingCanvasV2

#### Test Files:
- `test-api.js`
- `test-api-routes.js`
- `test-build.js`
- `test-dream-page.js`
- `test-vercel-deploy.js`

### 4. **Consolidated Systems**
- All prompt building now goes through the unified Unoform style system
- Removed duplicate kitchen design selection interfaces
- Migrated from simple kitchen types to comprehensive design system

### 5. **Updated Package.json**
- Removed scripts referencing deleted test files
- Simplified test commands to use `validate-env.js`

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated multiple prompt enhancement systems
2. **Improved Type Safety**: Using comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
3. **Better Maintainability**: Single source of truth for prompt building
4. **Smaller Bundle Size**: Removed ~15 unused files
5. **Cleaner Architecture**: Clear separation between old and new systems

## Migration Path

The codebase now uses:
- **New System**: `unoformPromptBuilder` → API routes
- **UI Components**: `KitchenDesignSelector` + `UnoformStyleSelector` → Advanced/Simple modes
- **Canvas**: `MaskDrawingCanvasV2` with professional features

## Files Removed Summary
- **15 component/utility files** deleted
- **5 test files** removed
- **~2000+ lines of code** eliminated
- **Build size** remains optimal at 163KB for dream page

The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and ready for future enhancements.
