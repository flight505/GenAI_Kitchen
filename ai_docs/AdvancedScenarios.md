Looking at the GenAI Kitchen application, I can see some exciting opportunities to expand its capabilities. Let me outline three realistic scenarios that customers might want but would struggle with the current implementation:

## Three Advanced Scenarios

### 1. **Reference Style Transfer**
**Customer Need:** "I love this kitchen from the Unoform showroom catalog, but I want to see how it would look in my actual kitchen space with my room dimensions and windows."
- **Current Limitation:** The app only transforms the uploaded image itself - it can't take style from one image and apply it to a different space.

### 2. **Empty Room Projection**
**Customer Need:** "We're building a new house and I have photos of the empty room where the kitchen will be. I want to visualize different Unoform kitchen designs in that actual space."
- **Current Limitation:** The current models (Canny Pro and Flux 1.1 Pro) expect existing kitchen structures to transform, not empty spaces to fill.

### 3. **Multi-Reference Composition**
**Customer Need:** "I like the cabinet style from Kitchen A, the island design from Kitchen B, and the color scheme from Kitchen C. Can we combine these elements in my kitchen?"
- **Current Limitation:** No support for multiple input images or selective feature extraction.

## Potential Models from Black Forest LabsBased on my research, here are the perfect models from Black Forest Labs to solve each scenario:

## Solutions Using FLUX.1 Tools

### 1. **Reference Style Transfer** - Use FLUX.1 Redux
FLUX.1 Redux is an adapter that allows mixing and recreating input images and text prompts. This model is perfect for:
- Taking style from the Unoform showroom catalog image
- Applying it to the customer's actual kitchen photo
- Given an input image, FLUX.1 Redux can reproduce the image with slight variation, allowing to refine a given image. It naturally integrates into more complex workflows unlocking image restyling

**Implementation approach:**
```javascript
// Use Redux to combine showroom style with customer kitchen
const reduxInput = {
  style_image: showroomKitchenUrl,
  target_image: customerKitchenUrl,
  prompt: "Apply Unoform Classic style from reference image to target kitchen space"
};
```

### 2. **Empty Room Projection** - Use FLUX.1 Depth + FLUX.1 Pro
FLUX.1 Depth: Models trained to enable structural guidance based on a depth map extracted from an input image and a text prompt. Perfect for:
- Extracting depth information from empty room photos
- Maintaining proper perspective when generating kitchen designs
- FLUX.1 Depth for retexturing images while maintaining 3D relationships, sketch enhancement, and controlled style transfer

**Implementation approach:**
```javascript
// First, extract depth from empty room
// Then use depth map with FLUX Pro to generate kitchen
const depthGuidedGeneration = {
  depth_map: extractedDepthMap,
  prompt: "Modern Unoform Copenhagen kitchen with exposed drawer boxes, full kitchen installation",
  preserve_perspective: true
};
```

### 3. **Multi-Reference Composition** - Use FLUX.1 Redux (Multi-Image Mode)
Merging 3 images at once into a new image with FLUX Redux adapter model. The model can:
- Combine elements from multiple reference images
- The feature is supported in our latest model FLUX1.1 [pro] Ultra, allowing for combining input images and text prompts to create high-quality 4-megapixel outputs

**Implementation approach:**
```javascript
// Redux can merge multiple images
const multiReferenceInput = {
  images: [
    { url: kitchenA, weight: 0.4, focus: "cabinet style" },
    { url: kitchenB, weight: 0.3, focus: "island design" },
    { url: kitchenC, weight: 0.3, focus: "color scheme" }
  ],
  target_image: customerKitchenUrl,
  prompt: "Combine cabinet style from first, island from second, colors from third"
};
```

## Additional Models for Enhanced Workflows

### FLUX.1 Fill
FLUX.1 Fill introduces advanced inpainting capabilities that surpass existing tools like Ideogram 2.0
- Perfect for selective editing after initial generation
- Additionally, FLUX.1 Fill supports outpainting, enabling the user to extend images beyond their original borders

### FLUX.1 Canny
FLUX.1 Canny: Models trained to enable structural guidance based on canny edges extracted from an input image and a text prompt
- Ideal for maintaining exact structural elements when needed
- Complementary to the current Canny Pro implementation

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

1. **Upgrade the Upload Tab** to support multiple image inputs:
   - Primary image (customer's space)
   - Reference images (up to 3)
   - Style transfer mode selection

2. **Add New Model Options**:
   ```typescript
   const FLUX_TOOLS = {
     'flux-redux': 'Style mixing and variation',
     'flux-depth': 'Empty room projection',
     'flux-fill': 'Advanced inpainting/outpainting',
     'flux-canny': 'Enhanced edge control'
   };
   ```

3. **Create Workflow Templates**:
   - "Showroom to Home" (Redux)
   - "Empty Room Design" (Depth + Pro)
   - "Mix & Match Styles" (Redux multi-image)

These FLUX.1 Tools are all available on Replicate and would dramatically expand the GenAI Kitchen application's capabilities to handle complex, real-world customer scenarios.
